/**
 * R4 — decorrelated non-LLM statistical/lexical safety classifier
 * (Phase 6.5.2, ADR-0003 three-opinion output validation).
 *
 * The third, *non-correlated* opinion on an output. R5 (gpt-4.1-nano judge) and
 * R3 (Llama Guard) are both transformers and can miss the same adversarial
 * input together; this is a pure-JS lexical scorer, so it fails on genuinely
 * different inputs — which is the entire point of a decorrelated vote. No model,
 * no network, no Python sidecar: deterministic and sub-millisecond, so it also
 * runs inside the 6.5.3 eval harness as a CI-gating layer (R3 and R5 cannot —
 * they are non-deterministic and need an API key).
 *
 * ADR-0003 names this slot "fastText / pure lexical". A trained fastText model
 * would need a Python training pipeline and a model artefact (no off-the-shelf
 * child-safety model exists), neither of which the Node/Hono pipeline can host.
 * The pure-lexical implementation fills the same decorrelated-third-vote role
 * with a clean JS-only path.
 *
 * Scope: it deliberately covers the *semantic* harm categories the deterministic
 * R2 blocklist structurally cannot — self-harm euphemism and reproduction/sexual
 * framing, where the harm is in the phrasing rather than a bannable token. Weapon
 * /drug/contact-info detection stays with the blocklist (R2); duplicating it here
 * would buy correlation, not decorrelation.
