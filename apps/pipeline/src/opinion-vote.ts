/**
 * Three-opinion output vote (Phase 6.5.2, ADR-0003).
 *
 * Combines the three decorrelated opinions on a model output:
 *   - R5  the gpt-4.1-nano judge (general appropriateness)
 *   - R3  Llama Guard (purpose-built safety classifier)
 *   - R4  the pure-JS lexical classifier (non-LLM, decorrelated)
 *
 * Rule (ADR-0003): **any disagreement is treated as unsafe** → safe fallback.
 * The output is released only when all three opinions agree it is safe; a single
 * dissent blocks it. This is the whole point of decorrelated layers — two
 * independent things must fail before anything reaches a child.
